This is a demo of [this patch](https://gist.github.com/TylerRick/1ab5e797892ebce5f9b2b1d143b9b1a4),
which lets you use `content_for` within a fragment `cache` block.

To try it out, start server and go to http://localhost:3000/test/content_for_inside_cache

This demo currently uses Rails 5.2.

See [feature proposal](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/feature-request-ability-to-use-content-for-within-a-fragment-cache-block/75607)
for more information.
