This is a demo of [this pull request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/39600),
which lets you use `content_for` within a fragment `cache` block.

To try it out, start server and go to http://localhost:3000/test/content_for_inside_cache

To view the earlier version of this demo that uses [this
patch](https://gist.github.com/TylerRick/1ab5e797892ebce5f9b2b1d143b9b1a4)
(monkey patching) instead of a Rails fork, check out the
[using_patch](https://github.com/TylerRick/content_for_inside_cache_demo/tree/using_patch)
branch.
